Base Docker image to be used in Machine Learning projects, built as:

* Linux (currently Debian Bullseye "slim")
* Python 3 (currently 3.10)
* Several Python pip packages used in data science and machine learning, e.g.:
   * Numpy
   * Pandas
   * Scipy
   * Scikit-learn
   * LightGBM
   * XGBoost
   * TensorFlow
   * Keras
   * NLTK

This will be used as a base to build other Docker images.
